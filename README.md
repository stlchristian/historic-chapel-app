# Historic Chapel App #

This app was used, once upon a time, to log attendance at the SLCC chapel
services, every Tuesday and Friday. It's pretty largely based on the
same CRUD model as the
[historic cafeteria app](https://github.com/stlchristian/historic-cafeteria-app).

The app was used for a whole semester (maybe), and forgotten promptly.
Poor app, never really got a chance...
